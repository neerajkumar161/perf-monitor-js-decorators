# Performance Monitor

A performance monitoring tool implemented using JavaScript decorators, Babel, and the Blessed library.

## Introduction

Performance Monitor is a tool that allows you to measure and track the performance of specific functions or methods in your JavaScript code. By using decorators, you can easily annotate the functions you want to monitor and gather valuable insights about their execution time and resource usage.

The Performance Monitor utilizes Babel to enable experimental JavaScript features, including decorators. It also leverages the Blessed library to provide a command-line user interface for visualizing and interacting with the performance data.

## Features

- Decorator-based approach for simple and intuitive performance monitoring.
- Measures execution time of the requests.
- Command-line interface powered by Blessed for interactive visualization of performance data.
- Customizable options to control the monitoring behavior and visualization style.
